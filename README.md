## About
https://scashmore.github.io/Ashmore_Profile/

The goal of this project was to create an online portfolio for myself. The page is divided into four sections: about, work, resume, and contact.

### CSS

The primary methood of construction was css flexbox. Flexbox allows developers to position html elemnts on a page with 'minimal' struggle. I utilized other css tools such as borders, media queries text-shadow, and object-position/object-fit to add a bit of pizazzz to the page. I have also added some elements using bootstrap.

### Other Comments

Currently, all links in the header redirect the user to the proper section of the page. All links in the contact section are fully functional as well. In the work secition, two of the three images deploy projects. Beneath each picture "to git repo" links to the github repo for the coosponding project. Also, an updated resume has been added in the form of a pdf.
