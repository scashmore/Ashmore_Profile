## About

The goal of this project was to create an online portfolio for myself. The page is divided into four sections: about, work, resume, and contact.

### CSS

The primary methood of construction was css flexbox. Flexbox allows developers to position html elemnts on a page with 'minimal' struggle. I utilized other css tools such as borders, media queries text-shadow, and object-position/object-fit to add a bit of pizazzz to the page.

### Other Comments

Currently, all links in the header and footer redirect the user to the proper section of the page. All links in the contact section are fully functional as well. However, due to the lack of completed web projects, none of the projects link to an external pages as can be seen below.
